# Crunshitify

Ever wanted theatre mode on Crunchyroll because their site is shite and has a fixed 960px width?

Look no further!

Crunshitify is here to unshitify crunchyroll. Adds a fancy button which will blow up the video to fit your browser! No more full screen or tiny screen. Resize your browser to the perfect size for your viewing pleasure.

## Install

Get release "dist.crx" from Github

## Get started

Clone this repository, and then, in this directory:

1. `npm install`
2. `npx webpack`

Your unpacked Chrome extension will be compiled into `dist/`. You can load it into Chrome by enabling developer mode on the "Extensions" page, hitting "Load unpacked", and selecting the `dist/` folder. You can pack the extension into a `.crx` by using the "Pack extension" button on the same page.

Thanks to https://github.com/duo-labs/chrome-extension-boilerplate for the boilerplate
